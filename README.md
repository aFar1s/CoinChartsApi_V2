# Project2CoinChartsApi

This application was designed to import cryptocurrency data from various APIs and present the data in a manner that is usable to a trader.

- Currency selector to display desired currency. 

- Sorting feature to sort the data in the desired manner.

- Clickable components to display historical charts and more detailed endpoints.

- Main page endpoints include Logo, Name, Ticker symbol, Price in selected currency, Market Capitalisation in selected currency and Percentage Price Change over 7 days in green for % > 1 or red for % < 1.
